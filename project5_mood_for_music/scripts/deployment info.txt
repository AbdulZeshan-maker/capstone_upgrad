Deployment details
Additional Considerations:
Directory Structure:

The app.py file should be placed in the root directory of your project.
Inside the same folder, you should have a templates/ folder containing the HTML files (index.html, result.html).
Also, create an uploads/ folder to store the uploaded images.
Templates:

templates/index.html (for the homepage upload form):

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Mood Detection and Music Recommendation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Upload an Image for Mood Detection</h1>
    <form action="/predict" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="file" accept="image/*">
        <input type="submit" value="Upload and Predict">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
templates/result.html (for displaying prediction and recommendations):

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Prediction Result</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Predicted Mood: {{ mood }}</h1>
    <h2>Recommended Songs:</h2>
    <ul>
        {% for song in songs %}
        <li>{{ song['name'] }} by {{ song['artist'] }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    <a href="/">Go Back</a>
</body>
</html>
Deployment:
For deployment, you’ll need a server that supports Flask apps. Here are a few options:

Heroku: A simple way to deploy Python apps. You'll need to create a Procfile with the following content:
makefile
Copy code
web: python app.py
DigitalOcean or AWS EC2: You can deploy using gunicorn for production environments.
bash
Copy code
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
This app.py allows you to upload images, predict the mood, and recommend music based on the predicted mood. You can now test locally before uploading it to your server or cloud platform.
