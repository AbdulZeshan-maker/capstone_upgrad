# Project4: Fire Data Analysis

## Project Structure

- **data/**: This folder contains the link to the datasets used for training and testing. The actual datasets are not stored in the repository due to their large size.
- **notebook/**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook `project_4.ipynb` which includes all the code for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **scripts/**: Contains Python scripts for different functionalities, such as data preprocessing and model deployment.
- not created model folder because of lack of gpu processinng is taking lot of time and he amount of data is 6gb , so please manage model accordin to your device
- **visuals/**: This folder contains screenshots and images of various visualizations and outputs generated during the analysis.
- **requirement.txt**: A file listing all necessary Python libraries to run the project.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirement.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebook` folder and open `project_4.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
5. The trained model will be saved in the `model` folder as `trained_model.h5`.
